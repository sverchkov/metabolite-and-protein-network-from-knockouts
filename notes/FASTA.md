## FASTA headers

The following is a description of FASTA headers for UniProtKB (including alternative isoforms), UniRef, UniParc and archived UniProtKB versions. NCBI’s program formatdb (in particular its -o option) is compatible with the UniProtKB fasta headers.

### UniProtKB
```
>db|UniqueIdentifier|EntryName ProteinName OS=OrganismName OX=OrganismIdentifier [GN=GeneName ]PE=ProteinExistence SV=SequenceVersion
```

Where:

* `db` is ‘sp’ for UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and ‘tr’ for UniProtKB/TrEMBL.
* `UniqueIdentifier` is the primary accession number of the UniProtKB entry.
* `EntryName` is the entry name of the UniProtKB entry.
* `ProteinName` is the recommended name of the UniProtKB entry as annotated in the RecName field. For UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries without a RecName field, the SubName field is used. In case of multiple SubNames, the first one is used. The ‘precursor’ attribute is excluded, ‘Fragment’ is included with the name if applicable.
* `OrganismName` is the scientific name of the organism of the UniProtKB entry.
* `OrganismIdentifier` is the unique identifier of the source organism, assigned by the NCBI.
* `GeneName` is the first gene name of the UniProtKB entry. If there is no gene name, OrderedLocusName or ORFname, the GN field is not listed.
* `ProteinExistence` is the numerical value describing the evidence for the existence of the protein.
* `SequenceVersion` is the version number of the sequence.

Examples:
```
>sp|Q8I6R7|ACN2_ACAGO Acanthoscurrin-2 (Fragment) OS=Acanthoscurria gomesiana OX=115339 GN=acantho2 PE=1 SV=1
>sp|P27748|ACOX_CUPNH Acetoin catabolism protein X OS=Cupriavidus necator (strain ATCC 17699 / H16 / DSM 428 / Stanier 337) OX=381666 GN=acoX PE=4 SV=2
>sp|P04224|HA22_MOUSE H-2 class II histocompatibility antigen, E-K alpha chain OS=Mus musculus OX=10090 PE=1 SV=1

>tr|Q3SA23|Q3SA23_9HIV1 Protein Nef (Fragment) OS=Human immunodeficiency virus 1  OX=11676 GN=nef PE=3 SV=1
>tr|Q8N2H2|Q8N2H2_HUMAN cDNA FLJ90785 fis, clone THYRO1001457, moderately similar to H.sapiens protein kinase C mu OS=Homo sapiens OX=9606 PE=2 SV=1
```

#### Alternative isoforms (this only applies to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot): 

```
>sp|IsoID|EntryName Isoform IsoformName of ProteinName OS=OrganismName OX=OrganismIdentifier[ GN=GeneName]
```

Where:

* IsoID is the isoform identifier as assigned in the ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS section of the UniProtKB entry.
* IsoformName is the isoform name as annotated in the ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS Name field of the UniProtKB entry.
* ProteinExistence and SequenceVersion do not apply to alternative isoforms (ProteinExistence is dependent on the number of cDNA sequences, which is not known for individual isoforms).

Example:

```
>sp|Q4R572-2|1433B_MACFA Isoform Short of 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha OS=Macaca fascicularis OX=9541 GN=YWHAB
```

### UniRef

```
>UniqueIdentifier ClusterName n=Members Tax=TaxonName TaxID=TaxonIdentifier RepID=RepresentativeMember
```

Where:

* UniqueIdentifier is the primary accession number of the UniRef cluster.
* ClusterName is the name of the UniRef cluster.
* Members is the number of UniRef cluster members.
* TaxonName is the scientific name of the lowest common taxon shared by all UniRef cluster members.
* TaxonIdentifier is the NCBI taxonomy identifier of the lowest common taxon shared by all UniRef cluster members.
* RepresentativeMember is the entry name of the representative member of the UniRef cluster.

Example:

```
>UniRef50_Q9K794 Putative AgrB-like protein n=2 Tax=Bacillus TaxID=1386 RepID=AGRB_BACHD
```

### UniParc

```
>UniqueIdentifier status=Status
```

Where:

* UniqueIdentifier is the primary accession number of the UniParc entry.
* Status is ‘active’ if the UniParc entry has at least one active cross-reference, and ‘inactive’ if it does not have any active cross-references.

Example:

```
>UPI0000000005 status=active
```

### Archived UniProtKB sequence versions

```
>db|UniqueIdentifier archived from Release ReleaseNumber ReleaseDate SV=SequenceVersion
```

Where:

* db is ‘sp’ for UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and ‘tr’ for UniProtKB/TrEMBL.
* UniqueIdentifier is the primary accession number of the UniProtKB entry.
* ReleaseNumber refers to the release from which the sequence was archived (Swiss-Prot or TrEMBL release numbers for releases prior to the first UniProt release, and both UniProt and Swiss-Prot or TrEMBL release numbers for releases after the first UniProt release).
* ReleaseDate is the date of the release form which the sequence was archived.
* SequenceVersion is the version number of the sequence.

Examples:

‘pre-UniProt’:

```
>sp|P05067 archived from Release 18.0 01-MAY-1991 SV=3
>tr|Q55167 archived from Release 17.0 01-JUN-2001 SV=1
```

‘post-UniProt’:

```
>sp|P05067 archived from Release 9.2/51.2 28-NOV-2006 SV=3
>tr|A0RTJ8 archived from Release 11.0/36.0 29-MAY-2007 SV=1
```
