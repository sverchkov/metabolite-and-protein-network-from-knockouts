This file describes how we prepare the information from [STRING](https://string-db.org) for our analysis.

STRING provides protein-protein interaction data.
The data is available in several large files online.
Our workflow is as follows:

 1. Download the data (see `scripts/download-bgk.sh`). This downloads annotated protein-protein interactions ("protein actions") and a mapping file for mapping between STRING and Uniprot IDs.
 2. The above script also filters the (quite large) protein interaction table to only interactions involving human proteins.
 3. Build a map between STRING IDs and the Uniprot IDs that appear in our data. For this we use `R/load-string-db.R`.
