In our data we have:

 * Perturbed entities, which are genes and/or open reading frames that have been knocked out by CRISPR
 * Measured entities, differential abundances of which have been measured by mass spectrometry, which include:
    * Proteins
    * Metabolites
    * Lipids
   
Using statistical methods we build networks among these entities, such as nested effects models and correlational networks.

We wish to be able to annotate these networks using available background knowledge about the relations between entities, such as metabolic pathways and signaling pathways.
Available sources of background knowledge include:

 * KEGG
 * BioCyc
 * ..[todo]
 
## Workflow

The workflow for accomplishing this task involves:

 1. Establishing unique IDs for the perturbed and measured entities
 2. Building inferred networks using the data-driven method
 3. Mapping our unique IDs to the IDs used by the background knowledge sources
 4. Extracting the relation information from the background knowledge sources
 5. Annotating the learned networks
 
### Establishing unique IDs

The unique IDs we use for our data are:

 * Knockouts: Gene name/ORF number
 * Proteins: UNIPROT IDs (Each measured protein corresponds to a string of one or more UNIPROT IDs.)
 * Metabolites: [todo]
 * Lipids: [todo]
 
### Building inferred networks

See other docs?

### Mapping to knowledge source IDs

For each knowledge source the mappings are as follows:

 * KEGG
    * Proteins: Uniprot IDs mapped to HSA numbers
    * Metabolites:
    * Lipids:
 * 2nd source
    * Proteins:
    * Metabolites:
    * Lipids:

### Extracting the relation information

Our data entails multiple possible types of relations, and each type may match multiple data sources

| Relation | KEGG | Source 2 | ... |
|----------|------|----------|-----|
| KO-KO
| KO-Protein
| KO-Metabolite
| KO-Lipid
| Protein-Protein
| Protein-Metabolite
| Protein-Lipid
| Metabolite-Metabolite
| Metabolite-Lipid
| Lipid-Lipid

### Annotating the networks
